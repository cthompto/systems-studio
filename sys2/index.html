      <h2>Systems and the Built/Bureaucratic World</h2>

      <p>
        We are all compelled to engage with built and bureaucratic systems to
        move through the world. We are connected and reliant on vast networks of
        infrastructure for water, gas, electricity, internet, transportation,
        and more. We engage in a seemingly endless number of information systems
        to access healthcare, food, work, education, and on and on. Some of
        these systems feel invisible or benign while others seem actively
        hostile. Artists (perhaps more than most people) find themselves often
        at odds with systems and create work that challenges or explores the
        system they feel in opposition to.
      </p>
      <p>Lets consider the systems in our lives.</p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
      <h2>Reflection on Lived System Experience</h2>

      <p>
        Take a few minutes to list out some of the systems you come into contact
        with in a given week. Write down what the system is, how you access it,
        whether you have a positive or negative feeling towards the system, and
        any other thoughts you might have. Try to come up with at least 5
        systems.
      </p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
      <h2>Experience Mapping</h2>

      <p>
        Now choose 2 of the systems you listed and draw an overlapping map of
        the two systems. You can use any kind of symbols, notes, lines, etc to
        create your map. Think of how these systems overlap and how you might
        represent that on the page. An example might be a map of the sidewalks
        you walk on to get to school and work and a map of the cell towers your
        phone uses to connect to the internet. You do not need to have real
        data! You can produce an imagined system/network in place of real
        numbers.
      </p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
      <h2>Share</h2>

      <p>
        When finished, share your map with your group. Explain your choice of
        systems and who they do (or perhaps don't) connect.
      </p>
