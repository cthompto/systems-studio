      <h2>Exquisite Corpse</h2>

      <p>
        Started as a surrealist drawing game, the exquisite corpse has been a
        playful way for artists to generate combined but random imagery since
        its inception in the 1930â€™s. The basic premise is to fold a piece of
        paper into three sections (head, torso, and legs). You then have one
        person draw the head and fold it over so that their drawing is obscured
        leaving only lines to connect the head to the torse. The next person
        draws the torso and does the same, flips or folds the paper so only the
        last blank section is visible leaving marks to indicate the torso. The
        last person draws the legs and reveals the finished piece. The resulting
        figure should in theory be connected but its features and
        characteristics will be random/unrelated to one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this exercise I have created an exquisite corpse prompt generator
        for you to experiment with using JavaScript (p5.js). We will first
        explore the code and then you will modify it to your liking.

      <h2>Demo Code</h2>

      <p>Go to this link to view the code and a preview of the generator:</p>

      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
      <h2>Modify</h2>

      <p>
        Now that you have gotten an introduction, take the next 5-10 minutes to
        try and manipulate and code. Try adding new entries, changing the
        design, or changing the static text.

      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
      <h2>Share and Draw</h2>

      <p>
        Share your edits with the same group from the first session. Then, using
        your generators, make exquisite corpse drawings. Everyone should start
        with a blank sheet of paper and fold it into thirds. Then, start with
        the top (head) section and use your generator to decide what to draw.
        Draw the head then fold it backwards to obscure the head being sure to
        leave guidelines. Pass the paper to a group mate and repeat with the
        torso and then the legs. Do not look at the previous person's drawing!
        When finished unfold to reveal your drawings.
