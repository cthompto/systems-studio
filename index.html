      <p>Methods for creating and using systems in studio practice</p>
      <p>A Workshop by Chelsea Thompto</p>
      <h1>Overview</h1>

      <p>
        A workshop exploring how systems can be used in the studio to generate
        forms, explore visual languages, organize thoughts, and more. This
        workshop will consider both analog and computational systems as tools
        and frameworks for studio making.

        This site is designed to accompany an in-person workshop but the links,
        activities, and information found here are free for you to share and
        explore!

      <h2>Required Materials</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Laptop with access to the internet</li>

        <li>Sketchbook and pen or other drawing tools</li>

        <li>
          Random number generated device (deck of cards, dice, numbers in a hat,
          etc.)
        </li>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>
        Artists working across all media can employ systems in their work both
        intentionally or subconsciously. In my own work, I create systems to
        generate works through code and other means while also critically
        interrogating oppressive systems I encounter in my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps you can already think of how you use systems in your work. If
        so, this workshop will hopefully offer you new ways to think critically
        about how and why you engage with systems. If you don’t think you work
        with systems, then consider this workshop an invitation to explore a new
        way of thinking and making.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my work, I use systems to generate and explore forms, process
        gathered materials, and interrogate societal structures. I have been
        using systems in my work for a long time but I didn’t have the language
        to think about it directly until the last few years. One early example
        of systems in my work is this piece from around 2011, made during my
        undergraduate studies in sculpture:
      </p>
      <p>&lt;insert image of swans here></p>
      <p>&lt;insert caption></p>
      <p>
        Overtime, I became drawn to more complex systems and began creating
        systems for obfuscating text:
      </p>
      <p>&lt;insert image of transcode here></p>
      <p>&lt;insert caption></p>
      <p>
        As I moved todays using more creative coding in my practice, I began
        making systems for processing and exploring archives and ideas:
      </p>
      <p>&lt;insert productive bodies image></p>
      <p>&lt;insert caption></p>
      <p>A rendering <em>Productive Bodies</em> can be found here:</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://vimeo.com/373514499">https://vimeo.com/373514499</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        In these and other works, I deploy systems in order to create a
        foundation for creative exploration. By recognizing and identifying the
        use of systems in my practice I now have greater agency in the creation,
        modification, and sometimes destruction or violation of these systems.
        So whether or not you are already using systems in your work, this
        workshop can hopefully offer you new ways to think about your create
        tendencies and perhaps provide new avenues for creative exploration.
